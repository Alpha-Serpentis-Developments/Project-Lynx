# Notice

Project Lynx is an actively developing project that is in its early stages of development. Up-time is not currently not in active use due to constant testing when changing the code, especially when it comes to data storage.

We cannot guarantee that data stored on "Lucky Lynx," the public Discord bot, will not be altered via various means. You may wish to self-host the bot and be able to compile/decompile the code as needed using an IDE or another code editor.

# Project Lynx
