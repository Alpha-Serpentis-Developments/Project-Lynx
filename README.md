# Discord-Lynx
A Discord Bot built using the [JDA Library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and Java.

Project Lynx (aka Discord-Lynx) is an experimental multi-purpose Discord bot that can be deployed with ease via self-hosting or using the public Lucky Lynx bot!

If you plan to self-host, use the following instructions to set your key:

# Option #1: Directly Modify "depend/key.txt"
1. Download the source code
2. Go to "depend/key.txt" and replace the entire line with your bot token.
# Option #2: Use an External Folder (Version 1)
... (finish this)
